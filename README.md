### MySQL Demos
MySQL Demos contain OCI scripts (in folder scripts, see howto for more details) for creating servers on OCI and also scripts (in client scripts) for starting the MySQL Server. They easiest way is to create a custom image on OCI and put all client scripts on that image.

There are also some demos on how to setup and run InnoDB Cluster and InnoDB ReplicaSet on OCI in the demos folder.

### Manual install of Kubernetes on OCI
In the folder "kubernetes-install" there is a text file covering how to install and and setup k8s.
